Hi all, this is the library of SQLs, if you have some diagnostic SQLs or Update SQLs to submit, feel free to make a new branch and I'll add it. The main point of creating this library is to not only make SQL more accessible to new support agents, but increase the speed at which you are able to diagnose issues, whether it be on QRF or as a Front Line Agent. If you would like to add a SQL, please follow the links below to be directed to the guide.

## Organization 

All items in the repository are sorted into folders. Inside the folders most of the diagnostics and updates are sorted by modules *(Accounting breaks off into Payables, Receivables, General Ledger, Etc.)* Inside each folder main folder, will be an updates and diagnostics folder. To find SQL statements for diagnosis, please view the diagnostics folder inside the respective module.
