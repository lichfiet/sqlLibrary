# Trevor's SQL Library

Hi all, this is the library of SQLs, if you have some diagnostic SQLs or Update SQLs to submit, feel free to make a new branch and I'll add it.

### How to Add a new SQL
#### **Important:** All SQL submissions must follow a format. To see the formatting guide, please look at the [**formatAndStylingGuide**](https://github.com/lichfiet/sqlLibrary/)

#### 1. Create a New File

#### 4. Wait

I'll take a look at your SQL and place it in the correct directory / make or request any changes before we add it to the repository

## Organization 

All items in the repository are sorted into folders. Inside the folders most of the diagnostics are sorted by modules *(Accounting breaks off into Payables, Receivables, General Ledger, Etc.)*
