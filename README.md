# Lightspeed Support SQL Library

Hi all, this is the library of SQLs, if you have some diagnostic SQLs or Update SQLs to submit, feel free to make a new branch and I'll add it. The main point of creating this library is to not only make SQL more accessible to new support agents, but increase the speed at which you are able to diagnose issues, whether it be on QRF or as a Front Line Agent. If you would like to add a SQL, please follow the links below to be directed to the guide.
