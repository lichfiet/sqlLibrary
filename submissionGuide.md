### How to Add a new SQL
#### **Important:** All SQL submissions must follow a format. To see the formatting guide, please look at the [**formatAndStylingGuide**](https://github.com/lichfiet/sqlLibrary/)

#### 1. Create a New File

#### 2. Enter new file information
- **File Name**: this can be named anything you would like, if you would like to change the location of the file, you may do so by formatting your filename like so ```directory/filename.ext``` this directory can be any prexisting folder, or one that you feel needs to be created.
- **SQL Statement**: Please follow the [formatting guide] when making your submission. All comments on SQLs are welcome. The more descriptive the better.
- After filling out information, **Click commit to save changes**

#### 3. Propose Changes
- **Commit Message**: Please include *if applicable* CR Number, and short title of the sql (no limit on length but make it simple *ie. invoice update statement*)
- **Extended Description**: Add a description explaining what your SQL does and the usecase, as well as any notes you feel neccesary.
- **New Branch Name**: name this anything you would like, but if possible, make it relevant to your submission *(ie. payableUpdateSql1)*

#### 4. Wait

I'll take a look at your SQL and place it in the correct directory / make or request any changes before we add it to the repository
